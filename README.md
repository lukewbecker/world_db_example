# World Data Mini-Project

## About the Project

- Purpose of this project is to practice creating an MVP on a database that I have easy/free access to, and then share it to Github for future updates.
- Ideas: Using a classification model, create a model that is able to predict with a fair amount of accuracy whether a city's population life-expectancy is above the world-wide average, or below the world-wide average.
- An alternative would be to predict if a city's population is living above the poverty line or not, or some other economic type metric.

### Planning
- Join all tables in the world_db from Codeup
-
